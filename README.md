# Bilingual Boys
**User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project**

There is currently a huge interest in Thailand for parents to advance their children's English ability by teaching them themselves. 
Even though children study English in school from a young age, the quality of lessons is often lacking. With this in mind, I have 
developed a website which addresses these needs.

Secondly, there is has been a sharp increase in the rate of mixed-race (Thai/non-Thai) marriages.  This, in turn, has led to an 
increase in couples/families emigrating to the UK from Thailand.

This website is the go-to site for any Thai (or Thai/British) family thinking of moving to the UK. It provides a realistic and up-to-date view
of what life in the UK is like for Thai families, what the visa requirements and procedures are and also English language lessons for both 
parents and children alike.

While there are a seemingly endless supply of English teaching resources flooding the internet, as well as a plethora of UK 
immigration services, the USP of this website is that it combines both of these from the perspective of a Thai/English family 
which has first-hand experience of the whole process. Being both in Thai and English, it is accessible to both Thai and English
speakers alike.

The ideal customer for the website would be:
* Thai
* Has children
* Looking to emigrate to the UK
* Someone who wants to improve his/her/their children's English

People visiting this website are looking for:
* Guidance on the UK immigration process
* Latest updates on UK visa guidelines
* Help with their English
* A real-life story of someone who succesfully has moved to the UK
* An insight into UK family life

Bilingual Boys is the ideal site for such people because:
* It includes all of the above in one place
* It has intuitive navigation and layout
* It is both clear and concise in its layout and content
* It leads them to register for the latest visa news

## UX
**Strategy**
User needs:  visa/immigration advice, basic English language tips/help, general interest in life in the UK

Having charted various opportunities/problems with associated perceived values of importance and viability, I decided that 
the website should focus on three main areas: Visa advice, 'survival' English lessons and a gallery giving a window to 
family life in the UK.
With the website being aimed at Thai/English families, it should have to text options: Thai and English.

Business objectives: make money through sales of English lessons, primarily to the Thai market. 

**Scope**
User Stories:
1. As someone thinking of moving to the UK, I want to see what life can be like so that I can make a better informed decision.
1. As someone thinking of moving to the UK, I want tips on the immigration process so that I can budget correctly and save time on paperwork.
1. As a Thai person living in the UK who struggles with English, I want help with the language so that my everyday life is improved.
1. As someone who has recently moved to the UK with children, I want an idea of what the UK is like for young children so that I can plan activities for them and make their lives more fulfilling.
1. As a Thai person living in Thailand who want to help my children with their English, I want language help specific to parents with children so that they progress quicker at school and have more opportunities later in life. 
1. As an interested observer, I want to be able to get the latest updates on social media so I can get the latest news and photos.

**Structure**
To make sure the content/functionality is intuitive to navigate, I maintained consistency throughout the different pages 
by using the same layout/structure (landing page sections matched the order of menu items) and header and footer elements.

On the landing page, I used content hinting so that users would be encouraged to scroll further down the page.

**Skeleton**
The key reasoning behind the design of the landing page was to disclose information progressively by giving snippets of what 
lay on other pages.  By using icons and breaking it into three main sections which mirror the three main user/business needs,
this also minimized cognitive overload.

By being consistent with the design and simplicity of all pages, it is both predictable and intuitive, and therefore increases the overall UX.

**Surface**
The 'Schoolbell' font was chosen to tie in with a young family feel, while the 'open sans' font was chosen to convey a modern and informative tone.  The images chosen 
for the parallax scrolling (which also match the pages they navigate to) wanted to maintain the family feel and also to help 
the user picture themselves living in the UK.  The colour scheme was chosen as it fits in with the eponymous boys and is also considered a reliable and trustworthy colour
which we want to reflect in the quality of the website's content.

## Technologies Employed
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Github/Gitpod
* BootstrapCDN (Bootstrap 4)
* Google fonts

## Features
**Implemented**
* The navbar hides/appears smoothly on scroll down/up (credits in the code) to give a modern feel and also to maximize the amount of screen real estate.
* The navbar collapses to a burger menu on smaller screens to further increase the available screen area.
* The same footer appears on every page to maintain consitency and give quick access to relevant social media links.
* The footer also includes a centrally located call-to-action button which encourages people to register for free.
* All pages are genarally laid out to conform to the F-shape which people usually scan a website (left-righ-left-down): hero image with 
a jumbotron containing key imformation overlaid to the left, then more decriptive content at the bottom.
* Jumbotrons contain clear, concise information to avoid cognitive overload.
* The home page has a clear call to action button placed stragically below rhetorical questions in order to encourage users to subscribe.
* The home page incorporates content hinting by partially revealing an element just above the fold.
* The home page uses a parallax effect to continue the modern feel.
* The gallery page incorporates a lightbox design (credits in the code) to keep the modern feel.

**Future Features to Implement**
* A Thai version of the entire website accessible via a navbar language option.
* Add a live chat option so that people can get answers to questions quickly.
* Payment system for English language lessons to enable business objectives to be met.
